Testing and Evaluation costs are included in the Design and Build figure.Costs have not necessarily been recorded in these categories and some arbitrary apportionment has been necessary.Marketing and customer relation costs have been excludedNHS Choices internal, client side management and other operational costs have also been excluded.Question 8, 8b, 8c & 8dWCAG A & AA automated and manual testing.Testing the site with disabled people.For 8-8d: NHS Choices has previously been informed, by both AbilityNet and RNIB, that it is difficult for any site the size of nhs.uk to be 100% conformant using automated tests only. It is not possible to automatically return a yes/no answer for all the WAI tests via a testing tool (for instance, an automated tool may return Òplease manually checkÓ); the answer is given in this context. Through a combination of automated and manual tests, AbilityNet feel that NHS Choices is able to conform to a sufficient level of WCAG 2 AA compliance.NHS Choices works with AbilityNet to perform manual and automated tests of the NHS site. The manual tests also include checks and tests with disabled users. These types of manual tests return more Ôreal lifeÕ feedback than automated tests alone.Through AbilityNet, a selection of page templates are chosen by NHS Choices and tested, with the average number of pages tested being 3000 on an automated test. NHS Choices also commissions AbilityNet to run manual tests on page templates before going live to ensure pages released to the public are accessible before release. When selecting the testing sample, NHS Choices endeavours to include pages of as many types as possible, i.e. the sample includes pages based on as many page templates as possible.Errors raised during a July 2011 audit of nhs.uk by AbilityNet have been fixed through the months up until November 2011 as part of an NHS Choices internal Accessibility Project. From November 2011 to February 2012, as part of the same accessibility project, internal staff training (by team specialty and relevancy) was undertaken. All NHS Choices departments have been instructed as part of the BS8878 Accessibility Standard and relevant Central Office of information (COI) documentation. This process of internal training is planned to continue during the life cycle of NHS Choices.Official automated and manual accessibility audits will be commissioned by NHSC and undertaken by AbilityNet on the following releases and dates (subject to change):¥ Release 21a, Preview environment: scheduled for release 30th March¥ Release 22, Preview environment: scheduled for release 4th MayFurther audits will be run during subsequent releases during their relevant Preview period. These release dates are not yet known and audits will be commissioned when release to the Preview environment is known by NHS Choices.NHS Choices also works closely with AbilityNet using the BS8878 accessibility standard to improve internal management and processes relating to accessibility.Question 12 & 12bCoding StandardsMeasures whether a siteÕs markup is standards-compliant as specified in TG117 Browser testing.(X)HTML CompliantTo conform to current government guidelines and regulations, NHS Choices uses XHTML 1.0 as the native HTML language.All development site templates are tested on browsers that constitute 1% or more of site traffic and found defects are fixed before release to the public. As a matter of best practice, Choices endeavours to make all pages XHTML Strict compliant.Where non-compliant code is found, NHS Choices validates these issues with their testing partner, AbilityNet, to understand whether these failures are likely to impact on users in real-world usage. Where an impact to the user is found, the issues are fixed. In some cases, issues are difficult to fix due to the technology being used and will have no impact in the Ôreal worldÕ. In these circumstances, agreement is sought by NHC Choices via their internal Accessibility Governance Board as to whether mitigation actions are justified in a value-for-money context.CSS ComplianceAs per government guidelines and regulations NHS Choices uses CSS2. NHS Choices does have additional non-conformant versions that are only loaded for users of Internet Explorer 6 as it is not possible to create a properly structured site for IE6 without breaking the CSS rules of CSS2 used by other browsers. As these CSS files are only read by IE6, they do not impact on validation of the siteÕs general CSS files.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These were obtained from a one off survey that was carried out when looking at how to improve the website. However, we have no reason to think the figures have changed much from last year because we receive many emails praising the attractiveness and quality of the information. Regarding the Quality measures, the only survey carried out in 2011/12 is the online user survey which is more about how people use the Trails themselves. There is one section which asks questions about information provision, but it isn't specifically aimed at the website, it covers things like leaflets (which we are not allowed to print now) and Guide Books, so the answers to Q3c have been taken from that but need to be read in that context.  It should be noted that the visitor numbers in the Usage section do not include the visitors to 2 National Trails, which have their own website hosted by local arrangement. However the National Trails website is the main conduit for visitors to find these websites. If the visitor numbers for the other two websites were included, the figures woud be approximately 40% higher, as they are both very popular coastal trails.  The National Trails website was designed in 2005, at a time when many of the standards referred to did not exist, or when different architecture protocols were in use. It is therefore necessary to provide some narrative around the answers provided in the last section. Re 8b, the website complies with most of standard AA, but not all e.g. Flash/the interactive maps don't comply, however all the content can be accessed by other means. Re 8d, the website was tested when launched, but no ongoing testing has been undertaken. The website does have a low vision design feature. Re 9 - 'availability' is not measured on an ongoing basis, however, no incident of unplanned down time can be recalled during this period.

It is our primary marketing and awareness tool.  It links a number of consultancy, training and software ecommerce sites into one location enabling an effective form of marketing and cross selling opportunities.  It is the ONLY mechanism for purchasing our training and therefore supports income in excess of £1m, the sites also link to an established course booking system which has significantly improved the effiencies of the back office function.  The software packages (IMBA & PC CREAM) are also bought, downloaded and maintained through the websites.  IMBA brings in ~£70k pa and PC CREAM ~£10-15k pa with the combination of software and training sales.  Our consultancy services can be bought online and where not available at this current time they will be in the future.  Enquiries and requests for quotes for services are being received for these services at ~5-10 per week.  These link to our back office enquiries and CRM management system which follows their process flow from enquiry to contact.  These enquiries can result in business from £1k - £30k.  The sites allow the commercial services to interact directly with customers (B2B) and give us an online presence (like our competitors!).  The sites link into further back office functionality to provide an integrated and efficient method of bringing income into the Agency.  An online customer satisfaction survey including provision for comments on the websites is available on the site although no-one has completed this yet.  The set up cost of £50k and ~£1k annual maintainence charges are modest given the current income is ~£1.5m with more ecommerce to be offered shortly.  The websites are open source so the appropriate business service manager can amend content to keep up to date e.g. add new courses/change prices so there is no requirement for an external web management team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Force does not have its own general website, being instead allocated a number of pages on the main MOD site. Whilst the MOD works through its current budget reduction (balancing the books) programme, which started in 2009, recruitment of police officers has been suspended, so this site has been largely inactive. However, the Force maintains it because recruitment will resume at some point.  User Surveys have been carried out in the past, but are not appropriate until recruitment activity resumes. It has been mooted that this site migrates to Facebook instead but no decision has yet been taken.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
